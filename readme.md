🛠️ Development Projects – Next.js Practice
Welcome to the Development repository!
This is a personal space where I explore and build development projects using Next.js. The goal of this repository is to learn, apply, and experiment with modern web development concepts through hands-on coding.


🚀 What You’ll Find Here
🌐 Next.js projects of varying complexity
📚 Practice on key concepts such as routing, API integration, server-side rendering (SSR), static site generation (SSG), and dynamic pages
🎨 UI/UX experiments using Tailwind CSS and other libraries
🧪 Small feature-based mini projects and component testing
💡 Notes, learnings, and code snippets for reference and revision


📌 Purpose
This repo serves as a learning journal and sandbox for:
Strengthening my skills in React and Next.js
Gaining hands-on experience with full-stack concepts
Exploring best practices in project structure, performance, and deployment


🏗️ Project Status
Active – I will keep updating this repository with new features, experiments, and projects as I continue learning and building.
